# Open WebUI Pipe Integration

Examples of Open WebUI Pipe Functions that use Context Compiler.

Tested target: Open WebUI `v0.8.12` (latest at time of testing).
Validated at runtime on stock Docker Open WebUI with a real backend model provider.

Compatibility note: OpenWebUI `0.9.x` changed `Users.get_user_by_id` to async.
These examples support both sync (`0.8.x`) and async (`0.9.x`) user lookup.

## Files

- `open_webui_pipe.py`: basic integration, no directive-drafter layer (recommended/default).
- `open_webui_pipe_with_directive_drafter.py`: optional/experimental directive-drafter layer (rule-based check first, then optional model fallback) before `engine.step(...)`.

## Setup

The minimal pipe path below is the easiest first-run flow and was runtime-validated in Docker via API flow with a real backend model.

1. Import `open_webui_pipe.py` (recommended/default) as a Function by URL.
2. Open WebUI installs `context-compiler>=0.7.4` from the function frontmatter requirements.
3. Enable the function.
4. Set `BASE_MODEL_ID` to a valid Open WebUI model id (required).
5. Select the pipe model in chat.

Open WebUI is a separate runtime and must already be installed/configured separately.
Open WebUI also needs at least one real backend model/provider configured (for example Ollama or OpenAI) so `BASE_MODEL_ID` resolves to an actual model.
Note: The `PROVIDER` environment contract used in LiteLLM examples/demos does not apply to OpenWebUI. OpenWebUI manages providers via its own connection settings and model IDs.

Checkpoint continuation in these examples requires `context-compiler>=0.7.4`.

### Model configuration

- Open: `http://localhost:3000/admin/functions`
- Verify `BASE_MODEL_ID` matches an existing Open WebUI model id exactly.
- Example:
  - `BASE_MODEL_ID = llama3.1:8b`
- Model ids are configured in: `Admin Panel → Settings → Models`

If using `open_webui_pipe_with_directive_drafter.py`:
- Install directive-drafter support in the Open WebUI environment:
  - `pip install context-compiler-directive-drafter`
- Open WebUI executes copied functions from a temp/cached location, so
  directive-drafter imports/resources must come from the installed package (not
  repo-relative paths).
- Set `PREPROCESSOR_PROMPT_PROFILE` to `default` for heuristic-first usage.
- Use `llama` only for LLM-only preprocessing with Llama-family models.
- Prompt files are loaded from the installed package prompts (`default`/`llama` profiles).
- Optional: set `PREPROCESSOR_MODEL_ID` to route fallback precompilation through
  a separate model. If unset, fallback uses `BASE_MODEL_ID`.
- Fallback routing is Open WebUI-native (no LiteLLM dependency for this pipe).
- The heuristic directive drafter is intentionally conservative and high-precision, and
  may abstain on mixed-prose natural language (for example, `i think we should
  use docker`). In those cases, behavior may remain passthrough unless fallback
  precompilation returns a validated canonical directive.
- If you configure invalid model ids, the pipe returns explicit runtime errors:
  - `BASE_MODEL_ID` not found in Open WebUI models
  - `PREPROCESSOR_MODEL_ID` not found in Open WebUI models

### Docker/manual install fallback

If frontmatter dependency installs are disabled, offline, or unavailable:

1. Open a shell in the Open WebUI container:
   - `docker exec -it <openwebui-container> sh`
2. Install the package manually:
  - Minimal pipe: `pip install "context-compiler>=0.7.4"`
  - Directive-drafter pipe: `pip install "context-compiler>=0.7.4" context-compiler-directive-drafter`
3. Import and enable the function in Open WebUI, then configure valves.

### Finding valid model ids

Use the Open WebUI model picker/list to copy exact model ids for `BASE_MODEL_ID`
(and optional `PREPROCESSOR_MODEL_ID` for the directive-drafter pipe).

## Limitations

- No durable external persistence (checkpoint continuation is in-process only).
- No multi-worker or cross-process guarantees.
- No Redis/DB/external storage.
- No Filters or Pipelines.
- No production hardening.
- Tied to Open WebUI internal helper/import paths by version.

## Manual Validation

Validate these behaviors:
- `clarify` short-circuits the LLM call.
- `passthrough` forwards input without state injection.
- `update` forwards with compiler state (`[[cc_state]]`) added to the request.
- chat isolation works with real chat ids.
- state is lost after restart (no external persistence).
- non-text input is bypassed.

Note: In the OpenWebUI example pipes, recognized directive-only `update`
decisions return fixed local acknowledgments and do not call the
downstream LLM.
Both pipes support an exact local inspection command: `show state`.
When the latest user message is exactly `show state` (case-insensitive after trim),
the pipe returns current compiler state locally and does not call the downstream model.
When trace is enabled, responses include concise evidence of decision kind,
active state, downstream LLM call/no-call, and whether state was injected.

Decision flow in both pipes:
- `passthrough`: call the downstream model with normal input.
- `clarify`: show `prompt_to_user`; do not change saved state.
- `update`: state changed; render local acknowledgment for directive-only input, or call downstream model with updated state injected.

For the directive-drafter pipe, if `engine.has_pending_clarification()` is true, bypass directive drafting and pass raw input directly to `engine.step(...)`.

## Behavioral comparisons

**Case 1**

- prompt(s): `clear state` → `change premise to formal tone`
- base model: “To adjust the tone… provide the original content…”
- basic pipe: `No premise exists yet. Use 'set premise ...' first.`
- directive-drafter pipe: `No premise exists yet. Use 'set premise ...' first.`
- why this matters: lifecycle rule is enforced in a fixed, repeatable way; base model drifts into generic rewriting help.

**Case 2**

- prompt(s): `clear state` → `use docker` → `prohibit docker`
- base model: generic Docker/prohibition guidance text
- basic pipe: `'docker' is already in use. Only one policy per item is allowed. Use 'reset policies' to change it.`
- directive-drafter pipe: same conflict clarify
- why this matters: the app asks before applying a conflicting change.

**Case 3**

- prompt(s): `clear state` → `use podman instead of docker`
- base model: generic “how to switch to Podman” tutorial
- basic pipe: `No exact policy found for "docker". Replacement requires an exact policy match...`
- directive-drafter pipe: same replacement clarify
- why this matters: the app only replaces a policy when the old item already exists.

**Case 4**

- prompt(s): `clear state` → `set premise to concise replies`
- base model: accepts conversational style phrasing
- basic pipe: `Did you mean 'set premise concise replies'?`
- directive-drafter pipe: same clarify (near-miss is not rewritten)
- why this matters: near-miss text is not silently rewritten.

**Case 5**

- prompt(s): `clear state` → `change premise concise replies`
- base model: generic “please clarify changes” response
- basic pipe: `Did you mean 'change premise to concise replies'?`
- directive-drafter pipe: same clarify (near-miss is passed through unchanged)
- why this matters: the app waits for explicit, valid directive text before changing state.
